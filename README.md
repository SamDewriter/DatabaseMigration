# Data Engineering - Change and automation
In this project, the datawarehouse built earlier https://github.com/SamDewriter/DataEngineering-DataWarehouse have to be migrated to more adpatable tech stack to enable the business to move faster and deliver value to the stakeholders in due and necessary time. The company that uses the first data warehouse has gotten more sales and therefore has the demand for the change of the existing tech stack to new, robust, and more scalable frameworks

The tasks carried out are as follows:
The Data warehouse was migrated from MYSQL to Postgres
The dashboarding platform - redash - was migrated to Apache superset
